Chrome Extension - Improves news websites by replacing them with a calming kitten GIF.

# Why?

Because news is depressing: https://wogan.blog/newskitten/

# How?

This extension checks the `window.location.host` of whatever page you're on, and if it's found in an internal list of news domains, the page is overwritten with the calming kitten GIF instead.

# Who?

* Extension: Wogan May (me!)
* Inspiration: The fine folks in #politics on zatech.co.za
* Calm Kitten: No idea where the original GIF comes from.
